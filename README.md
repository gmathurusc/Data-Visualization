# Data-Visualization
Apache Solr/ D3.js

In this project, we leverage Apache Solr index and the D3.js data visualization technology (http://d3js.org/) to interact and visualize search engine data.  

Apache Solr index was constructed from upstream JSON files representing job postings collected and crawled from the upstream http://www.computrabajo.com affiliate sites that primarily serve Mexico and South American countries.  

D3 was used to plot the data on the map, to answer a set of challenge questions focused on temporal and spatial aspects of the data queried by Solr in the backend.
